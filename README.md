# Gym Aloha Pick and Place with Imitation Learning  

This repository features a **custom OpenAI Gym environment**, **Gym Aloha Pick and Place**, designed for robotic **pick-and-place** tasks. It supports **imitation learning** and **reinforcement learning**, allowing agents to learn from demonstrations and self-play.  

### Features  
✅ **Custom Gym Environment**: Designed for robotic manipulation tasks.  
✅ **Pick-and-Place Task**: Simulated robotic object interaction.  
✅ **Imitation Learning & RL**: Implemented and tested with:  
  - **Behavioral Cloning (BC)**: Supervised Learning
  - **Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)**: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)  

✅ **Expert Demonstrations**: Use expert trajectories for training.  
✅ **Video Recording & Visualization**: Watch model predictions in action.  

### Research Goals  
This project explores **robotic imitation learning**, **inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)**, and **autonomous object manipulation**.  

### Installation & Usage  
Follow the setup instructions to install dependencies, register the environment, and train agents using **BC** or **GAIL**.
